<h1>What is Rojava?</h1>

Inspired by a talk I went to at the New School about an autonomous region
in northern Syria called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava">Rojava</a>, 
I made a site about the democratic experiment that's happening there. 

Built in Django, with some fun effects in jQuery. It's a little sparse right now, but I'm planning to build it out.
